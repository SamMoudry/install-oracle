# sql-database-index
I have been reading about databases and I learned that you can create an index on your database table and you can use that to search through a database faster.
So I plan on trying that out.

If you would like to see the logs yourself I put the database code in the database.sql file.


Seq Scan on customers  (cost=0.00..34.33 rows=76 width=94)


Bitmap Heap Scan on customers  (cost=5.04..24.96 rows=76 width=94)
